## Enhancements (optional)

#### 1) Add a header and footer to the project.
    Ideas:
     - The header should only be shown when the user is logged in.
     - The header shows the current user's email.
     - The header has an option to log out.
     - The footer fixed on the bottom of the window.
     - The header shows the back button if the user is on the Movie page

#### 2) Show off your testing skills
    Ideas:
     - Add unit tests to all helpers
     - Add component tests if you have created any
     - Add [Nightwatch.js](https://nightwatchjs.org/) or a similar tool and do some feature testing
     - Create a test plan for manual testing

#### 3) Show off your design and CSS skills and make (all?) the pages pretty
    Ideas:
     - Style some or all of the files in the /pages folder
     - Add styled components
     - Break out reusable components and collect them in a components folder, like styled text, inputs, buttons, alerts,...
     - If you actually used Figma or a similar tool to design, add a link ot screenshots.
     - Make the Home page more welcoming.
     - Add [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and show reusable components there

#### 4) Show off your data handling skills
    Ideas:
     - Add a Redux store and selectors
     - Add store driven error handling and loading
     - Add additional CRUD calls to /helpers/db
     - Make additions to the UI to show the calls in action
        (ATTENTION: Do NOT delete or alter data that was not created by yourself!)

#### 5) Any other ideas? Just go for it!
    Ideas:
     - Add packages you like to work with
     - Thoughts on how to structure the project better
     - Found and fixed a bug
     - ...
